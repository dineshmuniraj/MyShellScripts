//-p in mkdir creates parent directory also does not complain when you make a directory that already exists

//less command - to display the file content
less -N file1.txt shows a file with numbers at the beginning.
less * shows multiple files, and using Shift: + N for next file and Shift: + P for previous file

//ls .. shows the list of files in the parent directory
example - ls ../bin will show the contents of bin directory that is present in the root folder.
need to provide absolute path of the directory

//Symbolic link to a file
root@DESKTOP-1KMQFLC:/# ls -l /bin/python3
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 9 Mar 13  2020 /bin/python3 -> python3.8
root@DESKTOP-1KMQFLC:/# file /bin/python3
/bin/python3: symbolic link to python3.8
So, when we call python we can use /bin/python3.8 directly

//using ls to view hidden files
ls -a view hidden files
ls -l shows long listing file information like permisson, size, modification date
ls -h -l shows more file info in human readable format
this can also be written like this. ls -hl

//Using rm to remove files
rm -i asks if you want to delete a file
rm -v displays a message that the file was deleted.
rm does not remove directory by default, we should use rm -r 
rm -I deletes files recursively
Ex:
root@DESKTOP-1KMQFLC:~# rm -vIr src
rm: remove 1 argument recursively? yes
removed 'src/a'
removed directory 'src/files/water/beer'
removed directory 'src/files/water'
removed directory 'src/files'
removed directory 'src/no/yes'
removed directory 'src/no'
removed directory 'src/tom/test'
removed directory 'src/tom'
removed directory 'src/yes'
removed directory 'src'

//
cd ../.. takes you to the parent of parent directory.

//Create a symbolic link to Java
ln     -s    /usr/java/jdk1.8.0_45/    ~/java
